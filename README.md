# DS160_Final_Project

This project analyzes a 2018 Uber/Lyft Dataset from Boston, MA. The goal was to find out if price is influenced by weather patterns in Boston. To view my analysis, simply upload the .ipynb file to your Google Drive and open with Google Colab to view my analysis and all of the notebook's contents.
